From these summary statistics tables, we can see a few differences in weather between June and December, including:
- December, unsurprisingly, has colder temperatures. 
- The June list of measured temperatures has more data points (1700 observations) than the December list (1517). It would be helpful to explore the data further in order to better understand the reason behind this discrepancy. Did some weather stations shut down over the holidays? Was there a weather event that knocked a station offline? Was the data for a particular year incomplete or missing? Knowing the answers to these questions would allow us to rule out any factors that could skew our analysis.
